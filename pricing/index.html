    <h1>How much do we cost?</h1> 
    <p>We quote for every job individually with either a monthly recurring fee or an all-in cost for a self-contained project if you prefer. You'll find our fees are a little more than the average contractor but a lot less than the average agency.</p>

    <h1>Our place or yours?</h1> 
    <p>We normally work from our own office and communicate via phone and email. However, we can work from yours if you prefer and we're always happy to travel for face-to-face briefings or important meetings.</p>

    <h1>Why choose us?</h1> 
    <p>Life is short.  We won't judge you if you enjoy repeating your manual process every month but there are far more productive uses for your time.  Let us make the task disappear so that you can focus on your real goals.</p>
