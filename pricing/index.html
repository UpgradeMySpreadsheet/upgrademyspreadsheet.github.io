  <h2>How much do we cost?</h2> 
  <p>We quote for every job individually with either a monthly recurring fee or an all-in cost for a self-contained project. You'll find our fees are a little more than an average contractor but worth every penny.  A representative price for an automated reporting project is £20/month and we offer a 100% money back guarantee.  If after the first month you’re not happy with the value provided for your business, we will give you a full refund. We're very confident that UpgradeMySpreadsheet is the best investment you can make in the future of your business.</p>

  <h2>How do we work?</h2> 
  <p>You send us the step-by-step instructions for the routine task that you to disappear.  Depending on the task sometimes we ask for a sample input and output too.  We set our elves to work and build you an automated pipeline for your chore.  The task that ate up so much of your time is reduced to sending a single email each month.</p>

  <h2>Our place or yours?</h2> 
  <p>We normally work from our own office and communicate via phone and email. However, we can work from yours if you prefer and we're always happy to travel for face-to-face briefings or important meetings.</p>

  <h2>Why choose us?</h2> 
  <p>Life is short.  We won't judge you if you enjoy repeating your manual process every month but there are far more productive uses for your time.  Let us make the task disappear so that you can focus on your real goals.</p>
