    <h2>How much do we cost?</h2> 
    <p>We quote for every job individually with either a monthly recurring fee or an all-in cost for a self-contained project. Small projects cost very little, big projects cost a bit more but you'll find our fees are incredibly good value for money.  A little bit of code from us can save you hours/days/weeks of manual work.  We offer a 100% money back guarantee but are confident that UpgradeMySpreadsheet is the best investment you can make to improve your productivity.</p>

  <h2>What tools do we use?</h2> 
  <p>Most of our projects start and end as familiar Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  Behind the scenes we use an ever-growing mixture of programming languages and open-source tools.  Our main work-horse for data analysis and visualisation is Python.  Using a few clever scripts we can characterize the data in your spreadsheet and process it to any output you require.</p>

  <h2>Can we work with [fill-in-the-file-type]?</h2> 
  <p>Yes, yes, one hundred times yes!  Whether you send us Excel spreadsheets, Word documents or text files; its all just data to us.  We fear no file type!  Whether you work with telephone records, inventories, mailing lists, log files, emails or tweets; we can automate your task or help you discover valuable insights.

  <h2>Our place or yours?</h2> 
  <p>We normally work from our own office and communicate via phone and email. However, we can work from yours if you prefer and we're always happy to travel for face-to-face briefings or important meetings.</p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h2>Why choose us?</h2> 
  <p>Life is short.  We won't judge you if you enjoy repeating your manual process every month but there are far more productive uses for your time.  Let us make the task disappear so that you can focus on your real goals.</p>
