    <h2>How much do we cost?</h2> 
    <p>We quote for every job individually with either a monthly recurring fee or an all-in cost for a self-contained project. Small projects cost very little, big projects cost a bit more but you'll find our fees are incredibly good value for money.  A little bit of code from us can save you hours/days/weeks of manual work.  We offer a 100% money back guarantee but are confident that UpgradeMySpreadsheet is the best investment you can make to improve your productivity.</p>

  <h2>Our place or yours?</h2> 
  <p>We normally work from our own office and communicate via phone and email. However, we can work from yours if you prefer and we're always happy to travel for face-to-face briefings or important meetings.</p>

  <h2>Why choose us?</h2> 
  <p>Life is short.  We won't judge you if you enjoy repeating your manual process every month but there are far more productive uses for your time.  Let us make the task disappear so that you can focus on your real goals.</p>
