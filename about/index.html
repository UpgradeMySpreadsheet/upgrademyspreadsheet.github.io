    <h2>How do we do it?</h2> 
    <p>We like code.  We think code is a very good idea.  We have gotten really good at using code to turn inputs into outputs.  Our code isn't always pretty but it doesn't need to be.  Because you'll never see our code.  You'll send us your inputs, we'll do unimaginable magic behind the scenes and you'll find the finished product in your inbox.   We're like your own personal team of invisible software engineers.  </p>

    <h2>Why do we do what we do?</h2> 
    <p>Because 52,560,000 isn't really a big number.  That's the number of minutes in an optimistic lifespan of 100 years.  They get used up quickly.  You loose 1,440 of them every day.  We help our clients do more in the time they spend at work.  If you have to do any task more than once, automate it, automate the hell out of it; because life is too short not to!</p>

    <h2>Where are we?</h2> 
    <p>Our home office is in Edinburgh but everyone at UpgradeMySpreadsheet is free to live and work wherever they want.  Many of us love working remotely.  We're in the process of building satellite hubs in London and Dublin but have our sights set on our first US hub in 2016.  Look out New York City!</p>
