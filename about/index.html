  <h2>What do we do?</h2> 
  <p>We provide a smarter, hassle-free approach to increased productivity for busy professionals.  We automate the tasks you hate.  We make your recurring, time-consuming  admin chores disappear.   We provide a custom task automation service to help you reclaim time, reduce costs and ultimately increase productivity for your team and your company â€“ at the best price possible.</p>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h2>How do we do it?</h2> 
  <p>We like code.  We think code is a very good idea.  We have gotten really good at using code to turn inputs into outputs.  Our code isn't always pretty but it doesn't need to be; because you'll never see our code.  You'll send us your inputs, we'll do unimaginable magic behind the scenes and you'll find the finished product in your inbox.   We're like your own invisible team of ninja software engineers.</p>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h2>Why do we do what we do?</h2> 
  <p>Because 52,560,000 isn't really a big number.  That's the number of minutes in an optimistic lifespan of 100 years.  They get used up quickly.  You loose 1,440 of them every day.  We help our clients achieve more in the precious time they spend at work.  If you have to do any task more than once, automate it, automate the hell out of it; because life is too short not to!</p>

  <h2>Where do we do what we do?</h2> 
  <p>Our HQ is in the centre of Edinburgh City but everyone at UpgradeMySpreadsheet is free to work remotely from home.  We're in the process of establishing satellite hubs in London and Dublin but have our sights set on our first US hub in 2016.  Look out New York City!</p>
