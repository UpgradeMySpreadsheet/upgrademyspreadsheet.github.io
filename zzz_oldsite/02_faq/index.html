  <h2>What tools do we use?</h2> 
  <p>Most of our projects start and end as familiar Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  Behind the scenes we use an ever-growing mixture of programming languages and open-source tools.  Our main work-horse for data analysis and visualisation is Python.  Using a few clever scripts we can characterize the data in your spreadsheet and generate a unique high-quality dashboard.</p>
