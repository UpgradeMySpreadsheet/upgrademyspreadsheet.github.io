  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  <p>
  We're a small, versatile, global team of data superheroes.  We are spreadsheet specialists with a decade of experience in public and private companies.  Our mission is to build beautiful data dashboards for busy professionals. We exist to make data easier to understand.
  </p>
  <h2>Why we do what we do?</h2>
  <h3>1. Life is short</h3>  
  <p>
  UpgradeMySpreadsheet was born because the number 52,560,000 isn't as big as it seems.  That's the number of minutes in an optimistic lifespan of 100 years.  They get used up quickly.  You loose 1,440 of them every day!  We don't want you wasting your precious time on the planet wrestling with spreadsheets.  Unfortunately we can't help you live to 200 but we can make your business data easier to work with.  Let us build you a data dashboard and you'll save time and get more done.     
  </p>
  <h3>2. Data is messy</h3>  
  <p>
  Businesses produce data.  Sometimes alot, sometimes less, always complicated.  You're constantly bombarded with data and spend half your day just trying to understand it.  We take the pain out of your job.  We clean your messy data and generate a unique visual dashboard to help you answer the questions you need answered.     
  </p>
  <h3>3. We can help</h3>  
  <p>
  We're good at cleaning data.  We're good at building dashboards.  We're good at saving you time.  We take any spreadsheet of raw data, run it through our pipeline of data analysis mega-tools and send a custom-built, management dashboard straight to your inbox.  We provide a more efficient, cost-effective and scalable solution than any competitor in the market.  We’re proud to be trusted partner for a range of world-class brands and agencies.
