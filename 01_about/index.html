  <h2>Why we do what we do?</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>1. Life is short</h3>  
  <p>
  UpgradeMySpreadsheet was born because the number 52,560,000 isn't as big as it seems.  That's the number of minutes in an optimistic lifespan of 100 years.  They get used up quickly.  You loose 1,440 of them every day!  We don't want you wasting your precious time on the planet wrestling with spreadsheets.  Unfortunately we can't help you live to 200 but we can make your business data easier to work with.  Let us build you a data dashboard and you'll save time and get more done.     
  </p>

  <h3>2. Data is messy</h3>  
  <p>
  Businesses produce a lot of data.  Sometimes in big amounts, sometimes in not so big amounts.  The amount of data isn't usually a problem but the complexity can become a problem.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>3. We can help</h3>  
  <p>
  We're good at cleaning data.  We're good at building dashboards.  We're good at saving you time.
