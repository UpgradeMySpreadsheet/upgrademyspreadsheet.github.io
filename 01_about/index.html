  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  <p>
  We're a small, versatile, global team of data superheroes.  We build elegant, interactive dashboards for data of any shape or size.       
  </p>
  <h2>Why we do what we do?</h2>
  <h3>1. Life is short</h3>  
  <p>
  UpgradeMySpreadsheet was born because the number 52,560,000 isn't as big as it seems.  That's the number of minutes in an optimistic lifespan of 100 years.  They get used up quickly.  You loose 1,440 of them every day!  We don't want you wasting your precious time on the planet wrestling with spreadsheets.  Unfortunately we can't help you live to 200 but we can make your business data easier to work with.  Let us build you a data dashboard and you'll save time and get more done.     
  </p>
  <h3>2. Data is messy</h3>  
  <p>
  Businesses produce data.  Sometimes alot, sometimes less, always complicated.  You're constantly bombarded with data and spend half your day just trying to understand it.  We take the pain out of your job.  We take your spreadsheet of raw data, run it through our pipeline of data analysis mega-tools and send you a custom-built, visual data dashboard straight to your inbox.  
  </p>
  <h3>3. We can help</h3>  
  <p>
  We're good at cleaning data.  We're good at building dashboards.  We're good at saving you time.  We can help save you time, get more done and achieve your big goals.
